		"So far six confirmed dead and the helicopters are pulling into (Lancaster General Hospital) like crazy,.
		It was unclear if the shooter was among the six.
		Three girls, all critical with gunshot wounds, were admitted to Lancaster General Hospital.
		Police surrounded the one-room school late morning.m.
		Two hours later, about three dozen people in traditional Amish clothing, hats and bonnets stood near the small school building speaking to one another, several young people and authorities.
		U.S. schools have been especially sensitive to threats after deadly shootings last week at schools in Wisconsin and Colorado.
		 a school principal was gunned down in Cazenovia, Wisconsin, and a 15-year-old student, described as upset over a reprimand, was charged with murder.
		Just two days earlier, an adult gunman held six girls hostage in a school at Bailey, Colorado, before killing a 16 -year-old girl and then himself.
		 A procession of 34 buggies and carriages carried mourners to a hilltop cemetery as the Amish community buried the first of five girls killed by a gunman inside their tiny one-room schoolhouse.
		Two state troopers on horseback and a funeral director's black sedan with flashing yellow lights led the cortege, followed by a long horse- drawn buggy carrying the body of 7-year-old Naomi Rose Ebersol.
		The route wove past the home of Charles Carl Roberts IV, the 32-year- old milk truck driver who took the girls hostage morning, tied them up and then shot them.
		One Amish man craned his head out a buggy window to look at the home.
		It was the first in a series of funerals for victims of the West Nickel Mines Amish School shooting.
		All roads leading into the village of Nickel Mines were blocked by state police so the Amish could gather privately in homes to remember Ebersol; Marian Fisher, 13; and sisters Mary Liz Miller and Lena Miller, 7.
		The funeral for a fifth girl, Anna Mae Stoltzfus, 12.
		Dr. D. Holmes Morton, who runs a clinic that serves Amish children, said that the reports that a 6-year-old had been taken off life- support and taken home to die were accurate "as far as I know."
		"I just think at this point mostly these families want to be left alone in their grief and we ought to respect that,.
		National mourning of similar tragedies, such as the massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado, has been enabled in part by media coverage -- something the Amish generally shun.
		In Lancaster County, there have been prayer services for the Amish school shooting victims at area churches, but the traditional funerals for the girls were closed.
		About 300 to 500 people were expected at each, said funeral director Philip W. Furman.
		Amish custom calls for simple wooden caskets, narrow at the head and feet and wider in the middle.
		An Amish girl is typically laid to rest in a white dress, a cape, and a white prayer-covering on her head.
		The girls' families, Amish neighbors and friends are coping with the slayings by looking inward, relying on themselves and their faith, just as they have for centuries, to get them through what one Amish bishop called "our 9/11," referring to the terror attacks of 2001.
		"They know their children are going to heaven.
		They know their children are innocent... and they know that they will join them in death," said Gertrude Huntington, a Michigan researcher who has written a book about children in Amish society.
		"The hurt is very great,.
		"But they don't balance the hurt with hate."
		In just about any other community, a deadly school shooting would have brought demands from civic leaders for tighter gun laws and better security, and the victims' loved ones would have lashed out at the gunman's family or threatened to sue.
		But that is not the Amish way.
		In the aftermath of Monday's violence, the Amish have reached out to the family of the gunman, Charles Carl Roberts IV who committed suicide during the attack in a one-room schoolhouse.
		Dwight Lefever, a Roberts family spokesman, said an Amish neighbor comforted the Roberts family hours after the shooting and extended forgiveness to them.
		Among Roberts' survivors are his wife and three children.
		"I hope they stay around here and they'll have a lot of friends and a lot of support," said Daniel Esh, a 57-year-old Amish artist and woodworker whose three grandnephews were inside the school during the attack.
		Roberts' relatives may even receive money from a fund established to help victims and their families, said Kevin King, executive director of Mennonite Disaster services, an agency managing the donations.
		Though the Amish generally do not accept help from outside their community.
		In fact, it's wrong for us to ask.
		But we will accept them with humility."
		The attack on West Nickel Mines Amish School began morning when Roberts took over the one-room school.
		Investigators spoke to the two relatives Roberts named, who would have been 4 or 5 at the time.
		"They were absolutely sure they had no contact with Roberts," said state police Trooper Linette Quinn.
		There is talk among the Amish of tearing down the schoolhouse, which is now boarded up, said Daniel Esh, 57.
		On the roads into Nickel Mines early  families in traditional Amish dress, broad-brimmed hats and bonnets walked on foot and traveled in horse-drawn buggies.
		The clip-clop of the horses was broken up only by the roar of official helicopters overhead enforcing a no-fly zone over the region.
		Associated Press writer Martha Raffaele and photographer Carolyn Kaster contributed to this report.
		
		The gunman who stormed a one-room Amish schoolhouse was an ordinary man and a devoted father and showed few signs of trouble in the days before the attack.
		Neighbors and family members saw no indication of problems that would lead 32-year-old Charles Carl Roberts IV to open fire on a dozen young girls.
		"Absolutely not," said Lois Fiester, a relative of Roberts who was standing outside the family's modest ranch house.
		"They're a fine Christian family.
		It's ironic and it's heartbreaking."
		When the shooting stopped, three of the girls were dead.
		At least seven others were wounded, some critically.
		And Roberts had killed himself.
		State police hinted that Roberts was motivated by a childhood grudge, but they refused to divulge details.
		According to an obituary, Roberts and his wife lost a daughter shortly after she was born in 1997.
		Another neighbor, Dorothy Rineer said Roberts' wife had grown up in the neighborhood.
		Roberts, a truck driver who worked the night shift picking up milk from farms, also came from southeastern Lancaster County.
		"He was just an ordinary person,.
		Land O'Lakes, based in Arden Hills, Minnesota, issued a statement confirming that Roberts was employed as a truck driver and assigned to Northwest Food Products, a wholly owned Land O'Lakes subsidiary.
		No one answered the door at the Roberts' home 
		Firewood and children's toys, including two play guns, were on the porch.
		In the living room, visible through the front door, was a plaque reading "God Bless This House" and exercise equipment.
		A sand box and trampoline were in the back yard.
		In a statement released to reporters, Marie Roberts called her husband "loving, supportive and thoughtful."
		"He was an exceptional father,.
		"He took the kids to soccer practice and games."
		Josh Zook, an Amish man who lives three doors down, said: "I have no reason to think anything negative about him.
		It's just horrible."
		Zook was still waiting to hear whether one of his own relatives had been a victim in the attack.
		"I just want to go up there with a bulldozer and bulldoze that school down,.
		Charles Carl Roberts IV revealed to his family in notes he left behind and in a cell phone call from inside the West Nickel Mines Amish School that he was tormented by memories of molesting two young relatives 20 years ago.
		He also spoke of having dreams about doing it again.
		Investigators spoke to the two women, who would have been 4 or 5 at the time.
		"Both of them have no recollection of being sexually assaulted by Roberts,.
		
		Gov. Ed Rendell said he will ask Amish elders if they want state police protection from a Kansas church group that plans to demonstrate at funerals of five girls fatally shot in an attack on their one-room schoolhouse.
		Rendell also asked the members of the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas, as well as members of the public and news media, to allow the Amish to conduct their funerals in privacy.
		"I won't do anything that the Amish community doesn't want us to do,.
		"If they want us to do something, we will make sure that (church members) can demonstrate, but they demonstrate far enough away that they don't interfere with the privacy of the funerals."
		The Westboro Baptist Church routinely pickets military funerals, saying that American servicemen and women are dying overseas because God is displeased that the United States tolerates homosexuals.
		In a statement on its Web site, the church blamed Rendell for the deaths of the Amish children because of comments he made about the Westboro group on national television several months ago.
		"They're insane," Rendell responded when asked about the group's statement.
		In June, Rendell signed legislation into Pennsylvania law designed to restrict Westboro Baptist Church's picketing by making it a crime to demonstrate near a funeral or memorial service in Pennsylvania.
		morning, Charles Carl Roberts IV entered the West Nickel Mines Amish School in Lancaster County and shot 10 girls, killing five.
		Roberts killed himself as police stormed the building.
		 A man who laid siege to a one-room Amish schoolhouse, killing five girls, told his wife shortly before opening fire that he had molested two young girls who were his relatives decades ago and was tormented by "dreams of molesting again,.
		Charles Carl Roberts IV may have planned to molest the girls at the Amish school, but police have no evidence that he actually did.
		Roberts also had the weapons and supplies for long stand- off.
		"He states in his suicide note that he had dreams about doing what he did 20 years ago again,.
		Roberts was 32 when he killed himself 
		Roberts left one note for his wife, one for each of his three children and a note and checklist in his truck.
		The note to his wife talked about his anguish over the loss of the couple's newborn daughter, Elise, in 1997.
		"The note that he left for his wife talks about the good memories together, the tragedy with Elise, it focuses on his life being changed forever... over the loss of Elise, his hatred toward himself, his hatred towards God as a result of that event, and he alludes to this other reason for this anger but he can't discuss it with her and it happened 20 years ago,."
		When his wife spoke with Roberts by cell phone from inside the school before the shooting started, he "told her he had molested two minor relatives 20 years prior and that was how she put all of that together,.
		NICKEL MINES, Pa.
		He was a soccer dad, and a quiet hard-working, church-going family man.
		So those who knew Charlie Roberts were in a state of shock when authorities named him as the suicidal gunman who shot a classroom full of girls, execution style, in a tiny Amish schoolhouse.
		``The man who did this today is not the Charlie that I've been married to for almost 10 years," said Marie Roberts the alleged gunman's widow, in a statement released to the media.
